### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: Which past president is Donald Trump most like?
+ This project is conducted by [Yijia Li]

+ Project summary: As a well-known feature of Google, if you start typing in a search, Google offers autocomplete suggestions before you’ve even finished typing. I tried to type "Compare Trump to..", and the top four suggestions Google gave are "Compare Trump to Nixon/Lincoln/Mussolini/Obama," three of which are past presidents of the United States. This shows that people are most interested in comparing Trump to Nixon, Lincoln, and Obama. So, in this report, to analyze the similarities and differences between Trump and these three past presidents from a linguistic perspective, I will explore the texts of their inaugural speeches and visualize the results using text mining and natural language processing techniques. The following questions about their inaugural speeches will be answered.

1. What are their most frequently used words?
2. Do they like to use long or short sentences?
3. How do they shift between different sentiments in their speeches?
4. How do they alternate between different topics?
